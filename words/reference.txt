while searching for a name for the "reference" directory some alternatives were:
<> directory <!="oh yes a directory named directory">
<> manual < ="a book giving instructions or information."> 
<> vade mecum < ="a handbook or guide that is kept constantly at hand for consultation.", lang="modern latin">
<> enchiridion < ="a book containing essential information on a subject.", lang="greek->late latin">
<reason> really liked the "vade mecum" noun, but didnt feel like being a smartass <\reason>
